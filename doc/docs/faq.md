## How does the client know when to sync? Does it poll?

Typically, servers send a _poke_ (a content-less hint) over a websocket to tell the client to sync. There are many services you can use for this, and since no content flows over the socket there is no security/privacy concern. See the [integration guide](/guide/poke) for more information.

Replicache also polls at a low interval (60s by default) in case the poke mechanism fails or for applications that don't require low latency updates. You can adjust this using the [`pullInterval`](api/interfaces/ReplicacheOptions#pullInterval) field.

## What if I donâ€™t have a dedicated backend? I use serverless functions for my backend

No problem. You can implement the integration points as serverless functions. Our samples are all implemented this way.
