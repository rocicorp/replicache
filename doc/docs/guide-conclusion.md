And that's it!

We've setup a simple realtime offline-enabled chat application against a vanilla serverless/Postgres stack with the help of Replicache.

It's a little bit more work than an all-in-one system like Firebase, but you can implement it directly against your own stack without reliance on a giant third-party system.

This particular application is trivial, but the techniques generalize to much more complex systems. For example, see [Replidraw](https://replidraw.vercel.app) our realtime collaborative graphics editor.
