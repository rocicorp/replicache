You can follow the steps exactly to end up with our chat app, or use them as guide to build your own Replicache-enabled app.

## Prerequisites

You only need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), version 10.13 or higher to get started.

You should also already understand [How Replicache Works](../how-it-works) at a high level.
