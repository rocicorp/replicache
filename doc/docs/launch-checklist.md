Before you launch with Replicache in your product, it's a good idea to double-check that you have correctly covered all the small details of integration. This list can help you determine if you might have missed a detail, or deferred and then forgotten about one.

## JS SDK

- Ensure that you are passing in your own [Replipcache license key](/licensing)
- If you wish to change the signature of a mutator (eg, the number or type of
  its arguments) you must choose a new name; Replicache does not handle mutator
  versioning.
- At some point you will almost certainly wish to change the schema of mutations
  included in the `PushRequest` and the client view returned in the
  `PullResponse`. The `ReplicacheOptions.schemaVersion` exists to facilitate
  this; it can be set by your app and is passed in both the `PushRequest` and
  `PullRequest`. Consider setting the `schemaVersion` from the start so that you
  don't later have to special case the "no schemaVersion" case.
- If a user's auth token can expire during a session, causing your endpoints to
  return a 401, be sure that re-auth is handled for **Push** and **Pull** via
  `getAuth`.
- Ensure your use of `clientID` is correct. A `clientID` represents a unique
  running instance of the `Replicache` class. Typically in applications, each
  tab _load_ gets a unique `clientID`. Do not use the `clientID` as a stable
  identifier for a user, machine, or browser profile. **Note:** In multiplayer
  applications, a common and correct application of the `clientID` is to
  represent a running session (e.g., a mouse cursor), because in most
  multiplayer applications the design goal is that two tabs from the same user
  should show up as two separate cursors to other users.
- Do not use the `clientID` to look up what information was last sent to a
  client when computing the `PullResponse`. Since a `clientID` represents a
  unique running instance of `Replicache`, that design would result in each new
  tab pulling down a fresh snapshot. Instead, use the `cookie` feature of
  `PullResponse` to assign a unique ID to each returned pull. Replicache
  internally forks the cache when creating a new client and will reuse these
  cookie values across clients, resulting in new clients being able to startup
  from previous clients' state with minimal download at startup.
- The `name` property of `ReplicacheOptions` is required to differentiate
  Replicache instances for different users. This is important for the following
  reasons:
  - For efficiency and performance, a new [[Replicache]] instance will
    initialize its state from the persisted state of an existing [[Replicache]]
    instance with the same `name`, domain and browser profile.
  - Mutations from one [[Replicache]] instance may be pushed using the
    [[ReplicacheOptions.auth]], [[ReplicacheOptions.pushURL]],
    [[ReplicacheOptions.pullURL]], [[ReplicacheOptions.pusher]], and
    [[ReplicacheOptions.puller]] of another Replicache instance with the same
    `name`, domain and browser profile.

## All endpoints

- Ensure that you are authenticating the auth tokens configured via `ReplicacheOptions`, which are passed in the **Authentication** HTTP header.
- Your endpoints should return HTTP 401 to indicate that the user's authentication token is invalid (e.g., non-existent or expired), and that the app should re-authenticate them.
- Ensure that the `clientID` passed in does in fact belong to the authenticated user. Client IDs are random and cryptographically strong, but it is best to be safe.
- It is extremely important to ensure that your datastore and/or the way you use it guarantees the consistency and isolation properties required for Replicache to work as designed. These properties are:

  - the effects of a transaction are revealed atomically
  - within a transaction, reads are consistent, ie, reading the same item twice always results in the value, unless changed within the transaction
  - a transaction sees the effects of all previously committed transactions

  For example, MySQL's **SERIALIZABLE** isolation level provides these guarantees. We need to add here information for popular datastores, so if you would like us to look into your particular datastore or if you have any questions, please [contact us](https://replicache.dev/#contact).
